# Changes in fork
I don't know how did ModemManager for the original author, but for me it was crashing the modem. So I had to fork, write my own packages to manage cellular connection and SMS, and LuCI apps for them. Scripts are based on postmarketOS wiki advices.

Citation from postmarketOS wiki:
> On my UZ801 V3.2, the process of getting a fresh pmOS image to connect to LTE was rather painful. The internet lists some misleading instructions (qmi-network script does not work out of the box here), and in other cases suggests setting sysctl keys which do not exist. This device also does not work with ModemManager, nor ofono, straight up crashing the latter. Hence, all of this has been determined through manual trial and error.

`alias q='qmicli -d /dev/wwan0qmi0'`

> Device-specific quirks:
> - Setting the data format through `q --wda-set-data-format=raw-ip` does not seem to work. It falsely returns success, but `--wda-set-data-format` says 802-3 still. Instead, append `--device-open-net='net-raw-ip|net-no-qos-header'` to the `wds-start-network` call
> - `--client-cid=...` is evil and will hang `qmicli`. Of note, it doesn't hang the modem, just causes it to never respond, and `qmicli` is bad at handling timeouts
> - `--wds-go-dormant` / `--wds-go-active` doesn't do anything. Generally my version seems to be quite cut down, even `--wds-get-supported-messages` fails
> - `--client-no-release-cid` fails, use `--wds-follow-network` instead. This will lock up your shell, however. To disconnect, first ^C so `qmicli` sends a disconnection request to the modem, then ^Z, then `killall -9 qmicli` (otherwise it'll hang forever)
> - `qmicli` seems to be randomly unable to receive status back from the modem. This will result in "error: operation failed: Transaction timed out". This Is Fine™

sms-tool, [luci-app-3ginfo-lite](https://github.com/4IceG/luci-app-3ginfo-lite) also crashed the modem.

I removed:
- WireGuard
- ModemManager

Added:
- Russian language
- NFQUEUE
- PBR
- ksmbd
- mailsend
- [AmneziaWG](https://docs.amnezia.org/documentation/amnezia-wg/)
- kmod-ledtrig-netdev
- sing-box
- SMB server
- Kernel patch for counting RX/TX packets and bytes

Packages written from scratch:
- zhihe-qmi + luci-proto-zhiheqmi - for connecting to cellular network. Add `modem` interface with `Zhihe/Yiming QMI` protocol.
- modem-at-engine - ubus service to send AT commands to modem the way it doesn't crash :D
- sms-sqlite-sync + luci-app-sms-sqlite - checks for new SMS on SIM card every 3 minutes and moves them to database. Also able to send email about new SMS. LuCi app can show and send SMS.
- luci-app-cellular-info - information about cellular connection, signal strength, and nearby cells.

Unfortunately, I couldn't set up IPv6 on cellular connection :(

# How to install on Linux machine
1. Download all files from latest OpenWrt release ([releases page](https://github.com/ImMALWARE/uz801-openwrt/releases)).
2. Enable ADB on modem by opening http://192.168.100.1/usbdebug.html
3. Install adb and [edl tools](https://github.com/bkerler/edl) on your computer
4. When connected to modem via USB, run `adb reboot edl` to reboot into EDL mode
5. Make a full backup of your modem's firmware:
```
edl rf stock.bin
edl rl stock --genxml
```
6. `cd` to folder with downloaded files from step 1 and run:
```
chmod +x openwrt-msm89xx-msm8916-yiming-uz801v3-flash.sh
./openwrt-msm89xx-msm8916-yiming-uz801v3-flash.sh
```
7. Wait for the script to finish, then wait for modem to initialize. You should see new wired connection, and you can access LuCI at http://192.168.1.1
8. To connect to cellular network, go to Network -> Interfaces -> Add new interface, call it `modem`, set protocol to `Zhihe/Yiming QMI`.

# Set up email forwarding in sms-sqlite-sync
1. Enable email forwarding:
```sh
uci set sms_sync.main.enable_email='1'
```

2. Set SMTP parameters (example for Gmail app password):
```sh
uci set sms_sync.main.smtp_server='smtp.gmail.com'
uci set sms_sync.main.smtp_port='465'
uci set sms_sync.main.smtp_user='your_email@gmail.com'
uci set sms_sync.main.smtp_pass='your_app_password'
uci set sms_sync.main.email_to='destination@example.com'
uci set sms_sync.main.email_from='router@example.com'
```

3. Save config:
```sh
uci commit sms_sync
```
